title: "Introduction"
description: "BridgeAI is an intelligent lead-management and communication platform designed specifically for real estate agencies in the UK. It centralises all enquiries from portals, CRMs, WhatsApp, email, and website chatbots into one shared inbox, and enhances them with automated qualification, smart routing, and viewing-booking workflows.

By combining a CRM-hub, omni-channel messaging, and AI-driven automation, BridgeAI helps agencies respond faster, reduce manual work, and convert more leads into successful lettings and sales. The platform integrates with major UK CRMs and portals, unifies data into a consistent structure, and provides a scalable foundation for building advanced customer journeys.

BridgeAI aims to give agents a modern, efficient, and fully automated workflow—so they can focus on closing deals, not chasing inquiries."
