# Contact View

The Contact View shows all customer profiles and their associated requests inside the Shared Inbox.\
It is the high-level view where agents see the entire customer journey across all channels.

You can choose the way of view (per lead or per contact) by the settings:

## 1. Contact List

Here we decided to make other than the lead view, the contact view will gather all a customer messages in one conversation, so that the agency can see all the history of this customer in each channel.

We have two ways to show the contacts list in:

1- All channels together:

Here we will show the contacts and inside each one we will show their channels.

2- Per channel display:

## 2. Customer Request List

While we are showing all the history of a lead messages with a specific channel, we still preserve our logic with creating customer requests.

This gives us more control on how the flows are starting and ending in each request.

So that, we needed a way to show the customer requests of each customer by a list in the right sidebar:

![2025-12-03_13-34.png](/images/2025-12-03_13-34.png)

You can view more details about the customer request by:

![2025-12-03_13-34_1.png](/images/2025-12-03_13-34_1.png)

And you still can making actions like direct booking or direct qualification by:

## 3. Priority

Each contact can have a priority tag and the agency can change it anytime from the contact card in the list, like the following:

![2025-12-03_13-37.png](/images/2025-12-03_13-37.png)

This list of priorities can be configured in the settings:

## 4. Status

Each conversation/lead has a status, the available states are:

- In queue: The request is initialized but not contacted yet
- In Progress: The request is in progress and we didn't reach a final state like qualified, unqualifed, ...etc. yet.
- Contacted: The request is contacted.
- Booked: The lead book a viewing.
- Qualified: The lead is qualified for the property but there is no available dates to book.
- Unqualified: The lead is unqualified for the property.

## 5. Archiving

The agency can archive any contact by clicking on archive button, and they can show it in the archived section after that. Any message will be sent to this contact (by any channel) after archiving, the bot will not respond to it.
