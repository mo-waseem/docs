## 1. Conversation List

This part contains the list of the conversations, each lead will have a card in this list.

The lead can be from any source (Alto, Rightmove, OTM, ...etc.) and from any channel.

## 2. Conversation Childs

A conversation can have childs, those childs are generated by a number of scenarios:

1- Chasing by other channel, and the order of channel we contact applicants by is:

WhatsApp -\> SMS -\> Email

We are chasing the applicant if he didn't reply for an amount of time (this is configurable by the settings).

2- A similar properties request, we try here to suggest other properties for the applicant.

3- A new property available date request, here if we have a new property available date by the agency agent, we try to search for applicants who requested for this property before and didn't find available dates for viewing this property.

The following screenshot is for chasing by email:

## 3. Priority

We have a priority tag for each conversation, this tag can be configured in agency settings as well.

And the agency can change the priority tags from the settings as the following:

Each conversation/lead has a status, the available states are:

- In queue: The request is initialized but not contacted yet

## 5. Archiving

The agency can archive any request by clicking on archive button, and they can show it in the archived section after that. Any message will be sent to this request after archiving, the bot will not respond to it.
