## 2. Conversation Childs

A conversation can have childs, those childs are generated by a number of scenarios:

1- Chasing by other channel, and the order of channel we contact applicants by is:

WhatsApp -\> SMS -\> Email

We are chasing the applicant if he didn't reply for an amount of time (this is configurable by the settings).

2- A similar properties request, we try here to suggest other properties for the applicant.

3- A new property available date request, here if we have a new property available date by the agency agent, we try to search for applicants who requested for this property before and didn't find available dates for viewing this property.

The following screenshot is for chasing by email:
